## Theoretical Task 1.

### Question

> Зачем в облаке предусмотрено столько регионов? Зачем там кроме регионов еще и зоны?

> Why are there so many regions in the cloud? Why are there zones besides regions?

### Answer

A region is a defined geographic area that has been designed to guarantee the high availability and dependability of cloud resources. It is where a cloud provider offers its services. The user's location to an area has a direct impact on how quickly and easily they may access cloud resources. Crucially, any error that takes place in one area has no effect on other areas.

Regions are usually made up of several availability zones, which are actual physical data centers near together. Every availability zone functions autonomously, offering privacy from other areas. By guaranteeing that an error in one zone won't affect the operation of other zones, this configuration improves availability and dependability for cloud resources. Availability zones also make it easier to distribute the load within a certain area.
